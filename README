Building
========

Make sure that llvm-config is found on the shell search PATH, and that
the SQLite 3 development library files are installed.  Then running
"make" should be sufficient.

Running
=======

* In the top of the build tree of the project to be analyzed, run
  "create-db".  This creates the "htcondor-analyzer.sqlite" database
  file in which the results are stored.

* Run "cmake" (or "./configure"), with CC set to the "cc" script in
  the plugin directory, and "CXX" set to "cxx".  The scripts activate
  the clang plugin and pass through the other compiler arguments
  unmodified.

* Run "make" (or the build tool of your choice).

* Run the "report" program to obtain the output.  The output should
  always show all detected results for the entire source tree, even if
  the last build was only incremental.

Known issues
============

The plugin uses SQLite to persist analysis results.  Sometimes, an
SQLite transaction may not complete in the expected time (although the
timeout is fairly generous and should only trigger if the system is
severely overloaded).  This will result in a build failure.  Just
running "make" again will typically complete build.
